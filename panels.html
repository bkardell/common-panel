        This document describes a universal markup attempting to pave the cowpath 
        we observe for a construct called a <code>&lt;common-panel&gt;</code>
        which contains what appear to be common attributes and provide also
        and a single selection interaction paradigm for a collection of them called a
        <code>&lt;common-panel-set&gt;</code>.  Defining these allow editors to create a reusable 
        set of declarative code which remains semantic, widely stylable 
        in visual terms while retaining a conceptual and physical separation that retains 
        the important accessibility benefits for all of them.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        When editing a document, an author attempts to mark it up semantically and control 
        a separation of visual aspects through CSS.  This allows various the user-agent  
        and tools to use the same semantic data to provide any number of affordances 
        for accessibility, navigation, styling and interaction. Over time, UI designers 
        have created a number of common metaphors for visually managing and providing 
        single selection/focus navigation through a collection of titled 'blocks', which 
        are, themselves more complex and meaningful than it might seem at first glace. 
      </p>
      <p>
        While it is useful to have elements like <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> and 
        <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> which are high-level in their own right, it is also useful 
        to extract continually higher constructs as we see them emerge that add to our 
        ability to universally describe common things rather than rely on variable constructs
        and specialized knowledge about how they fit together to achieve something greater.
      </p>
        <p>Because the art of creating a good user interface is something we are all still 
        collectively trying to figure out, the history and development of these metaphors appear to 
        have obscured the underlying fact that in virtually every way, a number of them 
        are <em>conceptually</em> and in an very real sense <em>practically</em> nearly 
        identical in every way (in fact, the WAI-ARIA Best Practices document defines 
        accordions as a kind of <code>tablist</code> and in terms of keyboard navigation 
        says that UAs should treat up/down and left/right navigation for tabs and 
        accordions as interchangeable, for example) but are visually very different. 
        With the advent of ever more variant screen sizes, interaction methods, 
        responsive design, and a newly energized focus on accessibility, this question has 
        begun to come to the forefront of the mainstream:  We have designs which switch 
        their visual representation based on the current size of the screen, rather than 
        being constant. For example, on a wide screen, a tabbed interface may seem like a 
        natural choice, whereas the same interface is more natural as an accordion, or a 
        deck on a small one.  This proposal attempts to uncover the underlying structures 
        and interactions that accurately describe the common "thing" and provide ways and 
        examples of achieving robust separation in which CSS plays its intended role and 
        it is easy for authors to "do the right thing".

        <h1>Panels</h1>
        <p>
            The concept of a content panel is clearly established in both online and offline paradigms. It recurs in print and digital media, in documents and applications.
        </p>
		<p>
		A panel represents a chunk of content that can be displayed in a common fashion within a UI, and which behaves consistently in UA/AT. A panel may be a simple representation of content, or it may have certain characteristics such as the ability to be expanded/collapsed or removed from the UI completely.
		</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Basic Panel</h2>
        <p>
		Use case: An author wants to create a simple content container with consistent UA/AT features, that can be displayed in a common fashion.
        </p>
		<p>
		A basic panel may be adapted with visual or aural styles, but it remains a cohesive semantic thing. It is the basic building block for the use cases and design patterns in the remainder of this document.
		</p>

        <p>
            <pre class="example highlight prettyprint prettyprinted">&lt;fep-panel title="My favorite books"&gt;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;Here are a list of my favorite books:<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;ol&gt;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt;Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&lt;/li&gt;<br /> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/li&gt;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt;Green Eggs and Ham&lt;/li&gt;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/ol&gt;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />
        &lt;/fep-panel&gt;
           </pre>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Removable Panels</h2>
        <p>
		Use case: An author includes a panel containing content of secondary or ancillary importance, and wants to provide the user with the option to remove the panel from the UI.
		</p>
		<p>
		A removable panel has the <code>is-removable</code> attribute assigned to it. When the <code>is-removable</code> attribute is present, a mechanism to let the user dismiss the panel is provided. When the panel is dismissed by the user it is removed from the DOM.
		</p>
        <img src="dismissable-panel.png" >
        <pre class="example highlight prettyprint prettyprinted">&lt;common-panel common-title="Reminder" is-removable&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;Today is the first day of the rest of your life.&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;/common-panel&gt;
        </pre>
        <p class="note">
		The <code>is-removable</a> attribute is a standard platform <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/infrastructure.html#boolean-attribute">Boolean attribute</a>. The presence of <code>is-removable</code> represents the true state (the panel can be removed), and the absence of the attribute represents the false value (the panel cannot be removed).
		</p>
        </section>

        <section>
        <h2>Expandable/Collapsible Panels</h2>
		<p><strong>Use case:</strong> An author wants to make efficient use of screen real-estate by giving the user the ability to show/hide panel content. The user benefits by being able to manage "information noise" in a way that minimises cognitive load.</p>
        <p>an expandable/collapsible panel has the <code>expanded-state</code> attribute assigned to it. When the <code>expanded-state</code> attribute is present, the panel title becomes a control that allows the panel to be expanded/collapsed.</p>
        <p>If the <code>expanded-state</code> attribute is present but has no value, the starting state of the panel is collapsed. The <code>expanded-state</code> attribute may be set explicitly to <code>"open"</code>.</p>
        <img src="collapsable-panel.png" >
        <pre class="example highlight prettyprint prettyprinted">&lt;common-panel common-title="Today's News" expanded-state&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;Something &lt;a href="amazing.html"&gt;amazing&lt;/a&gt;happened on the Internet today...&lt;/p&gt;<br>
&lt;/common-panel&gt;<br>

        <section>
            <h2>Pseudo-Elements</h2>
            <p>
            A <code>&lt;common-panel&gt;</code> exposes the following pseudo-elements with built in semantics and functionality, and which can be used to achieve a wide number of visual presentation effects:
            <ul>
                <li><code>::--common-panel-header</code></li>
                <li><code>::--common-panel-icon</code></li>
                <li><code>::--common-panel-title</code></li>
                <li><code>::--common-panel-destroy</code> (if the is-removable attribute is set)</li>
            </ul>

            </code>
            <p>
                Styling may be managed via the provided pseudo-classes and user agents MAY choose how they indicate state by default.  UA MUST <span class="todo">(todo: DEFINE WHAT IT MUST DO vs WHAT IT MAY DO to automatically adjust).</span>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>DOM</h2>
            <p>
                <code>&lt;common-panel&gt;</code> elements expose a runtime property of "expansionState" which will 
                be "opened" or "closed".

        <h1>Panel Sets</h1>

        <p>When placed as a child of a <code>&lt;common-panel-set&gt;</code> element,
        the panel set will manage the selection/activation of a single <code>&lt;common-panel&gt;</code> at a time, 
        effectively managing their <code>collapse-state</code>.  In otherwords, <code>&lt;common-panel&gt;</code> element 
        children of a <code>&lt;common-panel-set&gt;</code> are automatically collapsable.  
        By default, the first <code>&lt;common-panel-set&gt</code> is considered expanded (not collapsed).
        Because the parser processes elements in document order, any subsequent claims of
        expansion trump the first by removing the attribute from siblings and setting their <code>collapse-state="closed"</code>.  Through this means, any number of styles are achievable:
        </p> 
        <p>
            Some examples of visual views on a single select <code>&lt;common-panel-sets&gt;</code> are
            <ul>
                <li>tabset/tabmenu</li>
                <li>accordion</li>
                <li>carousel</li>
                <li>deck</li>
                <li>coverflow</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <pre class="example highlight prettyprint prettyprinted">&lt;common-panel-set id="foo"&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;common-panel title="Panel #1"&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;If you can read this, tab #1 is expanded&lt;/p&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/common-panel&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;common-panel title="Panel #2"&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;If you can read this, tab #2 is expanded&lt;/p&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/common-panel&gt;<br>
&lt;/common-panel-set&gt;
        </pre>

        <p>The <code>&lt;common-panel-set&gt</code> exposes a DOM method like the <code>&lt;select&gt</code> element,
        exposing <code>.basic_panels</code> collection, a <code>basic_selectedIndex</code> property, and a <code>basic_selectedPanel</code> property.</p>


        <pre class="example highlight prettyprint prettyprinted">&lt;common-panel-set&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;common-panel id="bar" title="Panel #1"&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;If you can read this, tab #1 is expanded&lt;/p&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/common-panel&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;common-panel title="Panel #2" collapse-state="expanded"&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;If you can read this, tab #2 is expanded&lt;/p&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/common-panel&gt;<br>
&lt;common-panel-set&gt;<br>
&lt;script&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var panelSet = document.querySelector("#bar");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(panelSet.selectedIndex); // 1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(panelSet.basic_panels.length); // 2<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(panelSet.basic_selectedPanel); // the selected basic panel element<br>
&lt;script&gt;</pre>

      <p>
        A <code>&lt;common-panel&gt;</code> is defined as having:
        <ul>
           <li>An (optional) element for title (which allows use of CSS to ::before/::after) with attributes <em>is-destroyable</em> and <em>collapse-state</em> which can contain values "collapsed" or "expanded" (default)</li>
           <li>A body element</li>
