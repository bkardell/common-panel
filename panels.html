        This document describes a universal markup attempting to pave the cowpath 
        we observe for a construct called a <code>&lt;common-panel&gt;</code>
        which contains what appear to be common attributes and provide also
        and a single selection interaction paradigm for a collection of them called a
        <code>&lt;common-panel-set&gt;</code>.  Defining these allow editors to create a reusable 
        set of declarative code which remains semantic, widely stylable 
        in visual terms while retaining a conceptual and physical separation that retains 
        the important accessibility benefits for all of them.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        When editing a document, an author attempts to mark it up semantically and control 
        a separation of visual aspects through CSS.  This allows various the user-agent  
        and various tools to use the same semantic data to provide any number of affordances 
        for accessibility, navigation and interaction.  Over time, UIs have created a number 
        of metaphors for visually managing and providing single selection/focus navigation 
        through a collection of titled 'blocks'. 
        </p>
        <p>Because the art of creating a good user interface is something we are all still 
        trying to figure out, the history and development of these metaphors appear to 
        have obscured the underlying fact that in virtually every way, a number of them 
        are <em>conceptually</em> and in an very real sense <em>practically</em> nearly 
        identical in every way (in fact, the WAI-ARIA Best Practices document defines 
        accordions as a kind of <code>tablist</code> and in terms of keyboard navigation 
        says that UAs should treat up/down and left/right navigation for tabs and 
        accordions as interchangeable, for example) but are visually very different. 
        With the advent of ever more variant screen sizes, interaction methods, 
        responsive design, and a newly energized focus on accessibility, this question has 
        begun to come to the forefront of the mainstream:  We have designs which switch 
        their visual representation based on the current size of the screen, rather than 
        being constant. For example, on a wide screen, a tabbed interface may seem like a 
        natural choice, whereas the same interface is more natural as an accordion, or a 
        deck on a small one.  This proposal attempts to uncover the underlying structures 
        and interactions that accurately describe the common "thing" and provide ways and 
        examples of achieving robust separation in which CSS plays its intended role and 
        it is easy for authors to "do the right thing". 
    </p>
    <p>
        As an author, one would like to define a simple panel which has a title and have it 
        display in a common fashion and have common UA/AT features.

       <image src="titled-panel.png">
    </p>
    <p>
        To this end, we introduce a common markup element...
    </p>
        <pre class="example highlight prettyprint prettyprinted">&lt;common-panel title="Panels Rock"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don't you really think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/common-panel&gt;
       </pre>
    <p>
        which exposes the following pseudo-elements with built in semantics and functionality, and which can be used to 
        achieve a wide number of visual presentation effects:
        <ul>
            <li><code>::--common-panel-header</code></li>
            <li><code>::--common-panel-icon</code></li>
            <li><code>::--common-panel-title</code></li>
            <li><code>::--common-panel-destroy</code> (if the is-removable attribute is set)</li>
        </ul>

        UA MUST <span class="todo">(todo: DEFINE WHAT IT MUST DO vs WHAT IT MAY DO to automatically adjust).</span>
    </p>

    <p>

        <pre class="example highlight prettyprint prettyprinted">&lt;common-panel common-title="Removable Panels" is-removable&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don't you really think they do? You can click the button in the titlebar to remove this panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/common-panel&gt;
        </pre>

        <pre class="example highlight prettyprint prettyprinted">&lt;common-panel title="Collapsable Panels" collapse-state="collapsed"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don't you really think they do? This element was collapsed initially, if you can read this, it's been expanded&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/common-panel&gt;
        </pre>

        <div class="note">Define what aria/interactions a lone panel should have, if any.</div>

        <p>When placed as a child of a <code>&lt;common-panel-set&gt;</code> element,
        the panelset will manage the selection/activation of a <code>&lt;common-panel&gt;</code> at a time.
        The <code>collapse-state</code> of a panel indicates whether it is intended to be
        selected or not (any value other than <code>expanded</code> is considered collapsed.
        By default, the first <code>&lt;common-panel-set&gt</code> is considered expanded.
        Because the parser processes elements in document order, any subsequent claims of
        expansion trump the first by removing the attribute from siblings.
        </p>

        <pre class="example highlight prettyprint prettyprinted">&lt;common-panel-set id="foo"&gt;
    &lt;common-panel title="Panel #1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you can read this, tab #1 is expanded&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/common-panel&gt;
    &lt;common-panel title="Panel #2"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you can read this, tab #2 is expanded&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/common-panel&gt;
&lt;common-panel-set&gt;
        </pre>

        <p>The <code>&lt;common-panel-set&gt</code> provides a DOM method like the <code>&lt;select&gt</code> element,
        exposing <code>.basic_panels</code> collection, a <code>basic_selectedIndex</code> property, and a <code>basic_selectedPanel</code> property.</p>


        <pre class="example highlight prettyprint prettyprinted">&lt;common-panel-set&gt;
    &lt;common-panel id="bar" title="Panel #1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you can read this, tab #1 is expanded&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/common-panel&gt;
    &lt;common-panel title="Panel #2" collapse-state="expanded"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you can read this, tab #2 is expanded&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/common-panel&gt;
&lt;common-panel-set&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
    var panelSet = document.querySelector("#bar");
    console.log(panelSet.selectedIndex); // 1
    console.log(panelSet.basic_panels.length); // 2
    console.log(panelSet.basic_selectedPanel); // the selected basic panel element
&lt;script&gt;</pre>

    <p>
        Some examples of single select <code>&lt;common-panel-sets&gt;</code> are
        <ul>
            <li>tabset/tabmenu</li>
            <li>accordion</li>
            <li>carousel</li>
            <li>deck</li>
            <li>coverflow</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        A <code>&lt;common-panel&gt;</code> is defined as having:
        <ul>
           <li>An (optional) element for title (which allows use of CSS to ::before/::after) with attributes <em>is-destroyable</em> and <em>collapse-state</em> which can contain values "collapsed" or "expanded" (default)</li>
           <li>A body element</li>

        </ul>
