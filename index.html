        This document describes a universal markup attempting to pave the cowpath 
        we observe for a construct called a <code>&lt;common-panel&gt;</code>
        which contains what appear to be common attributes and provide also
        and a single selection interaction paradigm for a collection of them called a
        <code>&lt;common-panel-set&gt;</code>.  Defining these allow editors to create a reusable 
        set of declarative code which remains semantic, widely stylable 
        in visual terms while retaining a conceptual and physical separation that retains 
        the important accessibility benefits for all of them.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        When editing a document, an author attempts to mark it up semantically and control 
        a separation of visual aspects through CSS.  This allows various the user-agent  
        and tools to use the same semantic data to provide any number of affordances 
        for accessibility, navigation, styling and interaction. Over time, UI designers 
        have created a number of common metaphors for visually managing and providing 
        single selection/focus navigation through a collection of titled 'blocks', which 
        are, themselves more complex and meaningful than it might seem at first glace. 
      </p>
      <p>
        While it is useful to have elements like <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> and 
        <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> which are high-level in their own right, it is also useful 
        to extract continually higher constructs as we see them emerge that add to our 
        ability to universally describe common things rather than rely on variable constructs
        and specialized knowledge about how they fit together to achieve something greater.
      </p>
        <p>Because the art of creating a good user interface is something we are all still 
        collectively trying to figure out, the history and development of these metaphors appear to 
        have obscured the underlying fact that in virtually every way, a number of them 
        are <em>conceptually</em> and in an very real sense <em>practically</em> nearly 
        identical in every way (in fact, the WAI-ARIA Best Practices document defines 
        accordions as a kind of <code>tablist</code> and in terms of keyboard navigation 
        says that UAs should treat up/down and left/right navigation for tabs and 
        accordions as interchangeable, for example) but are visually very different. 
        With the advent of ever more variant screen sizes, interaction methods, 
        responsive design, and a newly energized focus on accessibility, this question has 
        begun to come to the forefront of the mainstream:  We have designs which switch 
        their visual representation based on the current size of the screen, rather than 
        being constant. For example, on a wide screen, a tabbed interface may seem like a 
        natural choice, whereas the same interface is more natural as an accordion, or a 
        deck on a small one.  This proposal attempts to uncover the underlying structures 
        and interactions that accurately describe the common "thing" and provide ways and 
        examples of achieving robust separation in which CSS plays its intended role and 
        it is easy for authors to "do the right thing". 
    </p>

        <h1>Panels</h1>
        <p>
            Starting from something very basic, the concept of a panel recurrs in print and online, in documents and applicaitons. 
        </p>

        <p>
            As an author, one would like to define a simple panel which has a title and have it 
            display in a common fashion and have common UA/AT features and a degree of ability to
            vary visual or aural and print styles while still remaining a cohesive semantic thing.
        </p>

        <image src="basic-common-panel.png" >
        <p>
            To this end, we introduce a common markup element...
        </p>
            <pre class="example highlight prettyprint prettyprinted">&lt;fep-panel title="My favorite books"&gt;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;Here are a list of my favorite books:<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;ol&gt;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt;Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&lt;/li&gt;<br /> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/li&gt;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt;Green Eggs and Ham&lt;/li&gt;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/ol&gt;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />
        &lt;/fep-panel&gt;
           </pre>
        <p>
            which exposes the following pseudo-elements with built in semantics and functionality, and which can be used to 
            achieve a wide number of visual presentation effects:
            <ul>
                <li><code>::--common-panel-header</code></li>
                <li><code>::--common-panel-icon</code></li>
                <li><code>::--common-panel-title</code></li>
                <li><code>::--common-panel-destroy</code> (if the is-removable attribute is set)</li>
            </ul>

            UA MUST <span class="todo">(todo: DEFINE WHAT IT MUST DO vs WHAT IT MAY DO to automatically adjust).</span>
        </p>

        <h2>Dismissable Panels</h2>
        <p>Another recurring theme in UI is that some panels are informational, they provide a necessary noise, but you'd like a user to be able to dismiss them.  Enter the <code>is-removable</code> boolean attribute.  If present it will add the ability to dismiss the panel, removing it from the DOM.</p>
        <image src="dismissable-panel.png" >
        <pre class="example highlight prettyprint prettyprinted">&lt;common-panel common-title="Reminder" is-removable&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today is the first day of the rest of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/common-panel&gt;
        </pre>

        <h2>Collapsable Panels</h2>
        <p>Sometimes panels are collapsable and sometimes they begin their being in a collapsed state.  Being collapsable means that a user can pontentially manage the noise selectively, over time.  To this end, there is the <code>collapse-state</code> attribute.  If present, the entire title manages a toggle of the state, it can optionally be set to <code>collapse-state="closed"</code> to set its initial value.  Styling may be managhkfjsed via the provided pseudo-classes and user agents MAY choose how they indicate state by default.</p>
        <image src="collapsable-panel.png" >
        <pre class="example highlight prettyprint prettyprinted">&lt;common-panel common-title="Today's News" collapse-state&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Something &lt;a href="#"&gt;amazing&lt;/a&gt;
  happened on the Internet today...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/common-panel&gt;
        </pre>

        <h1>Panel Sets</h1>

        <p>When placed as a child of a <code>&lt;common-panel-set&gt;</code> element,
        the panelset will manage the selection/activation of a <code>&lt;common-panel&gt;</code> at a time.
        The <code>collapse-state</code> of a panel indicates whether it is intended to be
        selected or not (any value other than <code>expanded</code> is considered collapsed.
        By default, the first <code>&lt;common-panel-set&gt</code> is considered expanded.
        Because the parser processes elements in document order, any subsequent claims of
        expansion trump the first by removing the attribute from siblings.
        </p>

        <pre class="example highlight prettyprint prettyprinted">&lt;common-panel-set id="foo"&gt;
    &lt;common-panel title="Panel #1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you can read this, tab #1 is expanded&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/common-panel&gt;
    &lt;common-panel title="Panel #2"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you can read this, tab #2 is expanded&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/common-panel&gt;
&lt;common-panel-set&gt;
        </pre>

        <p>The <code>&lt;common-panel-set&gt</code> provides a DOM method like the <code>&lt;select&gt</code> element,
        exposing <code>.basic_panels</code> collection, a <code>basic_selectedIndex</code> property, and a <code>basic_selectedPanel</code> property.</p>


        <pre class="example highlight prettyprint prettyprinted">&lt;common-panel-set&gt;
    &lt;common-panel id="bar" title="Panel #1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you can read this, tab #1 is expanded&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/common-panel&gt;
    &lt;common-panel title="Panel #2" collapse-state="expanded"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you can read this, tab #2 is expanded&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/common-panel&gt;
&lt;common-panel-set&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
    var panelSet = document.querySelector("#bar");
    console.log(panelSet.selectedIndex); // 1
    console.log(panelSet.basic_panels.length); // 2
    console.log(panelSet.basic_selectedPanel); // the selected basic panel element
&lt;script&gt;</pre>

    <p>
        Some examples of single select <code>&lt;common-panel-sets&gt;</code> are
        <ul>
            <li>tabset/tabmenu</li>
            <li>accordion</li>
            <li>carousel</li>
            <li>deck</li>
            <li>coverflow</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </section>

      <p>
        A <code>&lt;common-panel&gt;</code> is defined as having:
        <ul>
           <li>An (optional) element for title (which allows use of CSS to ::before/::after) with attributes <em>is-destroyable</em> and <em>collapse-state</em> which can contain values "collapsed" or "expanded" (default)</li>
           <li>A body element</li>

        </ul>
