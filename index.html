        This document describes a universal markup attempting to pave the cowpath
        we observe for a construct called a <code>&lt;common-panel&gt;</code>
        which contains what appear to be common attributes, and a single selection interaction paradigm for a collection of them called a
        <code>&lt;common-panel-set&gt;</code>.  Defining these will allow editors to create a reusable
        set of declarative code which remains semantic, widely stylable
        in visual terms while retaining a conceptual and physical separation that retains
        the important accessibility benefits for all of them.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        When editing a document, an author attempts to mark it up semantically and control
        a separation of visual aspects through CSS.  This allows user-agents and tools to use the same semantic data to provide any number of affordances for accessibility, navigation, styling and interaction. Over time, user interface designers
        have created a number of common metaphors for visually managing and providing
        single selection/focus navigation through a collection of titled 'blocks', which
        are, themselves more complex and meaningful than it might seem at first glance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently we have a number of useful building block elements like
        <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> which are high-level in
        their own right, but still beneath the level of describing many common constructs.
        It is useful then to attempt to extract more complex, higher-level constructs as
        we see them emerge.  Doing so, expands an author's ability to easily describe common things, and the  ability of user-agents, tools and search engines to make
        sense of them.
      </p>

      <p>The concept of a <em>panel</em> exists in traditional print media and has carried
        over into Web design.  Over time, UI/UX designers have created a number of common
        visual metaphors for managing interaction with a collection of panels: Accordions,
        tabs, decks and carousels are just a few.</p>

      <p>Because the art of creating a good user interface is something we are all still
        collectively trying to figure out, the history and development of these metaphors
        have generally taken the approach of independently naming these and solving each
        problem independently:  In the realm of custom elements, this means that you would
        have independent tags for each.  However, this obscures the underlying fact that
        in virtually every way they are <em>conceptually</em> identical.
        The WAI-ARIA Best Practices document, in fact,
        defines accordions as a kind of <code>tablist</code> and in terms of keyboard
        navigation says that UAs should treat up/down and left/right navigation for tabs and
        accordions as interchangeable.</p>

      <p>
        With the advent of ever more variant screen sizes, interaction methods,
        responsive design we now have designs which switch their visual representation of
        these metaphors based on the current size of the screen, rather than
        being constant. For example, on a wide screen, a tabbed interface may seem like a
        natural choice, whereas the same interface is more natural as an accordion, or a
        deck on a small one.  This further underscores their 'sameness'.
      </p>

      <p>These observations highlight the fact that their differences are primarily
        visual, not semantic:  How could a tabset suddenly <em>become</em> a wholly
        different thing based on screen resizing?  What difference does it make to
        the user of a screen reader that it is one or the other if their interaction
        model is unchanged?  And, if the difference is visual, shouldn't control of
        this be in the domain of CSS, rather than markup?</p>

    <p>This proposal attempts to solve the issues described in this introduction
        by defining these common elements and providing a separation of concerns
        which we believe strikes the right balances.</p>

        <h2>The panel element</h2>

 	  <p>
	    The concept of a content panel is clearly established in both online and offline paradigms. It recurs in print and digital media, in documents and applications.
      </p>
	  <p>
		 A panel represents a particular composed tree of DOM elements and pseudo elements around a chunk of content that can be displayed in a common fashion within a UI, and which behaves consistently in user agents and assistive technologies and provides optional functionality for managing operations like expansion/collapse or removal from the user interface entirely.
      </p>
      <img src="dom-panel-explained.png" alt="An illustration of composed tree of DOM elements and pseudo elements for a panel, details of which are explained in prose below">
      <p>
        On it's own, a panel may be used anywhere sectioning content is used, it is granted an <code>aria-role="group"</code>.  Elements and pseudo elements of the composite tree of a panel are.
         <ul>
             <li>
                <dl>
                    <dt>::--common-panel-header-box</dt>
                    <dd>Useful mainly for styling, this pseduo-element contains all of the visual elements of a conceptual 'header'.</dd>
                </dl>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <dl>
                            <dt>::--common-panel-header</dt>
                            <dd>When panel is used as standard sectioning content, this has default styles and provides hooks.  When panel is used as
                            a child of a &lt;common-panel-set&gt; this is granted special affordances (see that section for details).</dd>
                        </dl>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <dl>

                                    <dd>Optional visual styling hook for icon.  Empty/blank/dimensionless by default, it can be used to provide
                                    icons via background for cases having a relationship like browser tabs show the .ico.  Stylesheet authors can
                                    also use the ::before pseudo-element of this to provide a left-oriented expansion state indicator (see also ::-common-panel-hook)
                                    </dd>
                                </dl>

                                    via the ::after element to provide right-oriented expansion state indicator.</dd>

                            this will be shown and events wired to handle that behavior, if not, it will be hidden (including aria-hidden).  This element, when
                            present is focusable and announces its purpose.
                            </dd>

        <h2>The panelset element</h2>

        <p>When placed as a child of a <code>&lt;common-panel-set&gt;</code> element,
        the panel set will manage the selection/activation of a single <code>&lt;common-panel&gt;</code> at a time,
        effectively managing their <code>expansion-state</code> as panels and their Shadow DOM descendant's corresponding WAI-ARIA <code>aria-collapse</code>.  In otherwords, <code>&lt;common-panel&gt;</code> element
        children of a <code>&lt;common-panel-set&gt;</code> are automatically collapsable.
        By default, the first <code>&lt;common-panel-set&gt</code> is considered expanded (not collapsed).
        Because the parser processes elements in document order, any subsequent claims of
        expansion trump the first by removing the attribute from siblings and setting their <code>collapse-state="closed"</code>.  Through this means, any number of styles are achievable:
        </p>
        <p>
            Some examples of visual views on a single select <code>&lt;common-panel-sets&gt;</code> are
            <ul>
                <li>tabset/tabmenu</li>
                <li>accordion</li>
                <li>carousel</li>
                <li>deck</li>
                <li>coverflow</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

    <p class="issue">
        If HTML authors are encouraged to follow this separation, it inevitably begs the question about how CSS authors can
        correctly manage which type of display the element takes on in which conditions.  This is currently "up in the air"
        with one (not especially good, but currently prollyfilled) answer <a href="preferrential-display.html">here</a>.
